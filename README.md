# ExpressNoteTaker
An application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

## Business Context 
For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.

## Challenges
I had a hard time grasping a lot of the concepts of back end development with the short amount of time we have been working on them. Deploying to heroku and using express servers are much different than what we have been working on up until now, so switching up fundamentals like paths to other files was quite tricky. I also ran into issues when I converted the "var"s in the given index.js file to "consts" so I ended up changing many of them back in hopes that it would make all of the functionality return. In the end, I couldn't figure out the delete function.
